We all enjoyed the tour of Bandarban at 2018. It was the last tour before our graduation. Since then we all got very busy and couldn't plan another tour like that till 2022.

We should make a plan for India tour. It will be a blast if we could made it.

Bangladesh Cricket Team will visit UAE to play 2 T20's against UAE before their Tri-Nation Tour of New Zealand.
